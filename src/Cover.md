Lack of digitalization in AEC and education

The need of enhanced Collaboration and Communication within the AEC industry

Increasing pressure for improved cost and better time management

High demand for enhanced sustainability and Lifecycle Management

According to recent studies, the two fields lagging most behind in adopting the digital change are construction and education. The problem in construction sector is actually very serious, systemic, and all too common. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that almost anything can be digitalized, most and foremost, education. We want to use the generated momentum and take education one step closer to the digital future. On this line, we have contacted a series of stakeholders in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (shortly, AEC) industry to get their support to sketch-up the profile for an ideal candidate. Another input that is considered is the European plan for boosting the AEC productivity. Digital permits and compliance checks for buildings and infrastructure, data-driven distributed industrial environments and new breakthrough technologies for technological sovereignty in construction are just a few examples of European initiatives directed towards the AEC industry.

Furthermore, in specific partner countries (e.g., Romania), many AEC graduates change the working field to programming, mechanical development or automotive (software/hardware) testing due to limited employability or lack of 'coolness' in the field. With the rise of the Internet of Things, the AEC industry is seeing an increase in industrialization and digitalization, with an increasing demand for digital knowledge and skills. To support this, HEIs can support the digitalization of the industry by developing the required skills by offering courses and support.
